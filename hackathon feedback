Puzzle game*
A nice puzzle game where you recreate an image of superman.
You showed your skills with javascript drag and drop mechenism, dom manipulation,loops, conditionals and advanced array methods.
I would add some more styling to the project to make it look a bit more professional.
I would do a start game button and a restart game button. Also there is a bug where if you drag a puzzle piece into a box that already has
a puzzle piece the piece dissapears .
Other than that, 
 Good job guys!
